 Hey, I am saghana ✌️ 

  

I am a student studying Computer science Engineering. I am interested in full stack developing. Currently learning about data structures and back-end developing. 

I have a passion to learn and do something new out of it. I do not give up that easily; if a work is needed, I will complete it, especially in coding. 

  

“Our greatest weakness lies in giving up. The most certain way to succeed is always to try just one more time.” ―Thomas Edison 

  

What I am focusing on: 🤖 

Currently improving my back-end developing skills and data structures in python.
