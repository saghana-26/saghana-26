 Hey, I’m saghana ✌️

I am a student studying Computer science Engineering .I am intrested in full stack developing. Currently learning about data structures and back-end developing.
I have a passion to  learn and do something new out of it. I don't give up that easily ,if a work needs to be done I defenitly will complete it especially in coding.

“Our greatest weakness lies in giving up. The most certain way to succeed is always to try just one more time.” ―Thomas Edison

What I am focusing on 🤖
Currently improving my back-end developing skills and also data structures in python.
